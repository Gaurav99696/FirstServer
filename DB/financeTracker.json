      "description": "PocketGuard is a free budgeting app for people who want to be on top of their money. Personal finance is made simple by smart algorithms, which means budgeting with PocketGuard is so easy that you don't have to spend your entire life crunching numbers. We take care of all the routines like expense tracking and bill monitoring so you can clearly focus on money management operations.\n\nAlways know what's in your pocket!\nA budget is a difference between income and expenses. If it's positive - you're doing well. In any other case, the budget is unbalanced and needs attention. This is where the \"IN MY POCKET\" feature takes action. How much disposable income do you have after paying your bills, saving for your goals, and setting aside enough money for needs and wants? The PocketGuard budgeting app does those calculations for you! Always know the actual safe-to-spend amount so you can fit your monthly budget.  \n\nComprehensive analytics!\nBudget and expense tracking are just a part of the story. If you wanna do money management the right way you need to learn from the data you track. PocketGuard's free budgeting app provides you with various reports to let you see personal finances from different angles. Learn about your spending habits, make necessary adjustments, and optimize your monthly budget.\n\nBill tracker and subscription manager!\nYou can use PocketGuard as a bill organizer. Once you connect bank accounts the app starts working as a finance tracker. All your bills and subscriptions will be identified automatically and included in your monthly budget. The bill organizer will help you never miss the due date again.\n\nPocketGuard bill organizer gives you an easy way to negotiate better rates with your provider. So you can optimize your budget by cutting costs on services you use. PocketGuard subscription manager will help you to find subscriptions you might have forgotten about. This is another money management trick - stop paying for services you no longer need.  \n\nSet and reach your financial goals!\nGoals are a key concept of budgeting. As was mentioned before, expense tracking is just a part of the story. Personal finance is made of goals. Let's say you want to spend less on shopping or save more for vacation. These are financial goals. The PocketGuard budget app gives you all the necessary tools to set them properly.\n\nSet up your debt-payoff plan!\nNobody's perfect and almost anyone has debt to pay off. The question is: do you have a plan? Connect all your credit and loan accounts and we'll show you the way to a debt-free future. Our smart algorithm calculates the most profitable debt repayment strategy so you'll save hundreds or even thousands by paying less in interest!\n\nBANK-LEVEL SECURITY\nWe use the same 256-bit SSL encryption as all major banks to ensure your sensitive information is safe and sound. The PocketGuard app also uses PIN codes and biometrics, like Touch ID & Face ID, as an additional security layer.\n\nPocketGuard connects to U.S. and Canadian financial institutions only.\n\nPocketGuard offers a premium subscription - PocketGuard Plus - which gives you access to additional features and is not required to use PocketGuard.\n\nIf you choose to purchase PocketGuard Plus, payment will be charged to your iTunes account. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Auto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your settings in the iTunes Store after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period will be forfeited if you purchase a different subscription plan.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://pocketguard.com/privacy/\nTerms of Use: https://pocketguard.com/terms/",

      "description": "The Debt Payoff Planner app is the simplest way to stop feeling overwhelmed and start having a specific, step-by-step plan for paying off your loans.\n\nToday is the day to make a plan with a loan calculator and beginning paying down debt. Required inputs for calculating your debt free date are the current balance of the loan, the annual percentage rate (APR), and the minimum payment amount. That's the only requirement to getting a customized debt repayment schedule.\n\nEasy steps to becoming debt free:\n\n   - Enter your loans and debts\n   - Enter your additional monthly payment budget to pay down faster\n   - Choose a debt payoff strategy\n      * Dave Ramsey's Debt Snowball (lowest balance first)\n      * Debt Avalanche (highest rate first)\n      * Debt Snowflake (one-time extra payment toward loans)\n      * Custom debt free payoff plan\n\nDebt Payoff Planner and Loan Calculator determines the optimum payment plan and how long it will take until you will be debt free. You tell the app how much you want to budget toward paying off your debt and we'll tell you how.  We recommend the Debt Snowball strategy because we believe that paying off individual accounts faster will help you stay focused on your financial goal of debt elimination. A payoff plan is only useful if you stick with it!\n\nYour ability and willingness to pay more than the minimum payments is how you will become debt free in less time than you imagined. Budgeting your income will help you to get a regular monthly amount to pay down the debt faster. The payoff chart will show two payoff scenarios: only paying the minimum amounts, and the repayment schedule when you pay more the the minimum ever month.\n\nCreating an account enables you to have a secure backup and your information is immediately available if you start using a new device.  Getting out of debt is hard, so we try to allow you to take baby steps toward this goal.\n\nWe believe that becoming debt free requires an easy starting point and making sure every dollar is leveraged perfectly. The loan calculator has minimal inputs in order to make your money management easy to follow.\n\nThe Debt Payoff Planner and Calculator is also used for tracking payments and updating the time-frame for becoming debt-free. Inputting payment information is as simple as typing in the amount and the date the payment was made. The goal of payment tracking is to see your progress over time and affirm that you are staying focused on your financial goals.\n\nIn addition to being a debt tracker and loan calculator, we are also trying to help point out some possible next steps with articles focused on how to pay off student loans, auto loans, and credit cards faster.  Also, there is some tips on credit card balance transfers as well as strategies for debt consolidation.\n\nWe support eight loan categories:\n   * Credit Cards like Capital One, Citicard, Chase, etc.\n   * Student Loans like Navient, Sallie Mae, Great Lakes, etc.\n   * Auto/Car Loans\n   * Medical Loans\n   * Mortgages like Rocket Mortgage, SoFi, etc.\n   * Personal Loans to friends and family or other individuals\n   * Taxes like IRS or local municipalities\n   * Other category could be anything from a paycheck loan to a hard money loan\n\nIn addition to the Debt Snowball calculator and the Debt Avalanche method, many users like to do a custom sorting of their debts.  This customization is available for users that want to be their own debt manager.\n\nWe allow the ability to provide a Debt Snowflake payoff as well.  A Debt Snowflake is a one-time payment from things like a bonus at work, a tax refund, an extra payday, etc.  This additional capability allows you to have tighter control over every dollar you are budgeting.\n\nTerms of Service: https://www.debtpayoffplanner.com/terms-of-service/\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.debtpayoffplanner.com/privacy-policy/\nEnd-User License Agreement: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/",

      "description": "Weekly is a beautiful budgeting app based on a week.  No matter how often you are paid, weekly budgeting is the most effective way to stop overspending and save for your money goals.\n\nWeekly is both a budget planner and spending tracker.  Weekly starts with a simple guided setup where you put in all your recurring bills and income.  Next, you add in your savings goals.  Then based on those budget items, Weekly calculates for you your weekly spending limit.\n\nOnce your budget is set, our one-of-a-kind spending tracker monitors your day-to-day spending by downloading your transactions from your bank (or you can add them manually).  You can then quickly and easily organize your purchases into categories. We will show you how much you are spending on things like “Gas” and “Groceries” or any other category you would like to track. As the weeks go by you can see your average spending by category and challenge yourself to keep your “Safe-to-Spend” balance “in the green”. \n\nWeekly is perfect for household and personal budgets.  You can also share Weekly to stay on track with your budget with a spouse or partner.\n\nWeekly is also a great bill organizer.  On the dashboard you will see your upcoming bills and whether they have been paid.  Weekly will tell you the number of days left until the next bill is due.\n\nConnect your banks and credit cards to see all your account balances in one place.  Stay on top of our personal finances.   Stop overspending and feel great about starting to save money.\n\nTracking money with Weekly is fun.  Use emojis to represent your different recurring bills and safe-to-spend categories.  Weekly’s one tap review icons let you quickly confirm your transactions, striking the perfect balance between keeping you in touch with your money and giving you freedom in your life.\n\nThe steps to budgeting with Weekly.\n\nStep 1: Create Your Budget with the Budget Planner\n** Use our guided walkthrough to set up your budget.\n** Enter your regular income\n** Enter your recurring expenses such as your mortgage, car payments, loans, and utilities bills\n\nStep 2: Set Up Funds to Save for Your Goals\n** Create funds to save for your goals\n** Weekly automatically contributes money to your funds each week \n\nStep 3: Find Your Weekly Safe-To-Spend\n** Weekly calculates what you can safely spend each week\n** The calculation takes into account all recurring bills, income and savings goals.\n\nStep 4: Track Your Day-to-Day Spending with our Spending Tracker\n** Add in your daily transactions either manually or download them from your bank \n** Stay aware of your “Safe-to-Spend” number\n** Quickly and easily categorize your day-to-day spending   \n** See your category spending totals and averages\n** Spend worry-free knowing all your bills and savings goals are factored in\n\nStep 5: See Your Bills and Account Balances\n** See view upcoming bills and whether they have been paid \n** View all your account balances in one place\n** See how much cash you are saving\n\nUser Testimonials\n\n“Weekly has me saving so much more cash! … With Weekly, you concentrate on smaller, more manageable time and money chunks.”\n\nHappy User 1111, January 2021\n\n“Probably the most important app my wife and I have. It throws our ambiguity around finances out the window and sets us up for success each week with an easy to understand, easy to read budgeting app.”\n\nleajere – Jul 10, 2023\n\nWeekly is free to use or you can subscribe to Weekly PRO for our premium features.

      "description": "If you are looking for a personal finance app that is convenient, easy to use and at the same time has enough features, then Debit & Credit is the right app for you. \n\n• All Accounts in One App\nKeeping financial records was always a bit of a hassle. But now you can actually enjoy it. See all your accounts in one place and switch between them with one simple touch. \n\n• Super Fast\nCreating a new transaction now takes a matter of seconds.

And we will never require you to make dozens of unnecessary taps to accomplish simple tasks. \n\n• Locations (Geotagging)\nShopping frequently at the same place? Save its location to record expenses even faster. You can also get a list of saved payees sorted by distance. \n\n• Budgets & Scheduled Transactions\nDo you want to budget expenses on a particular category? No problems.

No problems, you can share selected accounts via iCloud while keeping other accounts private. Great for managing family finances!\n\n• Bank reconciliation mode\nSometimes we all need extra help to keep our accounts in shape. You can easily reconcile your accounts with bank statements in the app to eliminate any disparities. \n\n• Importing data\nWe know how important it is to be able to import transactions from your financial institutions. That's why we support CSV, QIF, QMTF, OFX and QFX files. And you can also choose which particular transactions to import from a file, something that not all financial apps know how to do.\n\n• Color Themes\nEight color themes are available for selection in the app settings in case if you want to customize your experience.\n\n• Watch App\nCreate new transactions on the go with the Apple Watch app. You can also check your budgets and pay scheduled transactions with it.\n\n• Powerful features\nSplit categories, pending transactions, URL schemes, file attachments, transaction tags, Siri, Touch ID and Face ID support, printing reports and saving them as PDF files - all those and many other features are at your disposal when you need them.\n\n• Mac version of the app\nYou can download macOS version of the app on the Mac App Store. It has even more features and syncs fast with the iOS companion via iCloud.\n\nSome features are limited to premium version subscribers. Premium version is an annual subscription. Our privacy policy, as well as subscription terms are available at https://debitandcredit.app/privacy-policy-with-terms.html.\n\nIn case of any questions please don't hesitate to contact support@debitandcreditapp.com.",

      "description": "The easiest, fastest bill manager in the App Store. A universal app for iPhone & iPad, with multitasking on iPad. Cloud sync works across all iOS devices plus Mac with the available Mac version.\n\nIf you pay bills, you need Chronicle.\n\nHere's why: A single late payment can cost you $30 or more and cause your credit score to plummet by up to 100 points. \n\nChronicle reminds you to pay your bills, so you can just enter them, and forget about them. \n\nPlus, Chronicle syncs with the available Mac version, so you can view and pay your bills everywhere.\n\nIn addition to reminding you to pay your bills, Chronicle keeps track of all your payment history, including confirmation numbers, so you always have proof of payments.\n\nNew to Chronicle is the Pro version. Available as an in-app purchase, Chronicle Pro gives you access to all new features of Chronicle as they are updated.\n\nCurrently available features in Chronicle Pro: \n\nForecast View: See the future—see what will be due every month for a year in advance.\n\nAmount to Save: Stop bills from sneaking up on you. Many bills don’t repeat every month: for these bills, Chronicle will calculate how much you need to set aside each month so that you have enough to pay it when it comes due. For example, you may have an auto insurance bill of $500 that is due every 6 months. Chronicle will calculate that you need to set aside $83.33 each month in order to have enough to pay the bill each time it is due.\n\nIntelligent Estimated Amount Due: Helps you know how much will be due for bills that vary. Using the type of bill, your payment history, and the time of year, Chronicle will intelligently calculate an estimate of how much is due. For example, Chronicle will be able to learn if your electric bills are higher or lower in the winter, and estimate accordingly.\n\nChronicle Cloud: Backup your bills to the cloud, sync across all your iOS devices, and share with a partner, spouse or business associate.\n\nChronicle Pro is an auto-renewing subscription. Subscription automatically renews unless canceled at least 24 hours prior end of the subscription. Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. You may cancel or disable your subscription by going to your App Store Account Settings after purchase. \n\nChronicle Pro is subject to the terms of use shown here: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/ \nYou can find the privacy policy for Chronicle Pro here: http://chronicleapp.com/privacy-policy/",
